  <section class="part5">
    <p id="line26" class="part5">So I woke up.</p>
    <p id="line27" class="part5">And it was beautiful.</p>
    <p id="line28" class="part5">And it was painful.</p>
    <p id="line29" class="part5">And it was real.</p>
    <p id="line30" class="part5">And I vowed that I would never dream again.</p>
    <p id="line31" class="part5">And that I would die to stay awake.</p>
    <p id="line32" class="part5">Because Now I am finally</p>
    <p id="line33" class="part5"></p>
  </section>
  <section class="part4">
    <p id="line18" class="part4">And I was afraid.</p>
    <p id="line19" class="part4">And the fear hurt.</p>
    <p id="line20" class="part4">And I wanted to go back.</p>
    <p id="line21" class="part4">Back to where it felt safe.</p>
    <p id="line22" class="part4">But now I could see it there waiting.</p>
    <p id="line23" class="part4">And I could not go back.</p>
    <p id="line24" class="part4">So I had no other choice.</p>
    <p id="line25" class="part4">I could not stay asleep.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="part3">
    <p id="line10" class="part3">But it never came.</p>
    <p id="line11" class="part3">So I started to look around. </p>
    <p id="line12" class="part3">And slowly I began to see the monster I had been ignoring for so long.</p>
    <p id="line13" class="part3">Bit by bit its grotesque form became clear. </p>
    <p id="line14" class="part3">I saw its dark oozing hide in the neighbors who wasted away their precious days in a passionless relationship, too afraid to strive for more.</p>
    <p id="line15" class="part3">I saw its cruel dead eyes in children I went to school with as they happily deluded themselves into complacency and ease, freely letting any uniqueness ebb into dumb conformity. </p>
    <p id="line16" class="part3">And I saw its greedy slavering maw in the intentions of my own parents as they unwittingly worked to condemn me to a live of boredom and servitude in the willfully ignorant notion that an early death is the worst fate that can befall a man.</p>
    <p id="line17" class="part3">I saw that this monster would devour every last shred of my initiative, independence and potential. And that it would do so slowly. It would eat me alive and leave me to watch myself become something that I despised.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="part2">
    <p id="line6" class="part2">I awaited the moment when I would finally wake up and experience the world for all of its beautiful realness.</p>
    <p id="line7" class="part2">I waited for it.</p>
    <p id="line8" class="part2">And I waited.</p>
    <p id="line9" class="part2">And waited.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="part1">
    <p id="line1">Once upon a time I was asleep.</p>
    <p id="line2">I drifted through my days dreaming of a life filled with vivid experience.</p>
    <p id="line3">I dreamed of a time when I would face consequence and blood.</p>
    <p id="line4">I dreamed of a time when I would be pushed to my limits and transcend the inconceivable.</p>
    <p id="line5">I dreamed of a time when I would fight and bleed and die in the name of firm belief and pursuit of destiny.</p>
